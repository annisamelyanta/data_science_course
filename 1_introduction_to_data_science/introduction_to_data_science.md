<h2> What is Data Science? </h2>

<p>
  <b> Data (/ˈdadə,ˈdādə/) : </b> Facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.
  
  <b> Science (/ˈsīəns/) : </b> 
  The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and 
  behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.
  
  Based on the understanding of the meaning of the word above, data science can be interpreted as an activity of observation and experimentation involving data. 
  Data science requires 3 skills:
  <ol>
    <li> Programming </li>
      <p> 
        The programming language that is usually used in data science is Python or R language. 
      </p>
    <li> Business </li>
      <p> 
        Business understanding is needed to understand the context of the issue or problem to be solved. 
      </p>
    <li> Statistics </li>
      <p>
        Statistics in data science are needed to carry out experimental activities such as testing hypotheses, 
        analyzing data, testing new initiatives will be better than current conditions. 
      </p>
  </ol>

  Can be concluded,
  
  <b> Data science : </b> 
  Knowledge that has skills in computer, programming, statistics, and business to assist data processing such as 
  data collection, data manipulation, data analysis, data modeling so that it can produce information in the form of 
  useful insights as a guide in making decision.
